# Superdisco

Superdisco's sole purpose is to make you sound like a top French DJ. Click on the squares to play the samples which all seamlessly go together. Be sure to choose 2 from the top row, 2 from the second row and any combination of 4 from the 3rd and last rows.

Once you hit eight...superdisco!
